=======
 Notes
=======
 * Use any number of search terms, in any order.
 * Search terms are not case sensitive, and order is irrelevant.
   * Use '-c' if you wish to reduce results by case-sensitive searching.
* Use '-t' to exclude the file's path to filter the search results.
   * Could possibly remove false positives (especially when searching numbers).
 * When updating from git or displaying help, search terms will be ignored.
